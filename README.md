# Deep Learning Projects

Here I publish my deep learning projects, mainly the once from my 
[Udacity][udacity] [Foundation Nanodegree][dl].

### Projects ###

#### DONE ####
*Project 1* - Your First Neural Network

>Build a simple network to make predictions of bike sharing usage. 

For this project we used a **Feed Forward Neural Network (FNN)** to predict the demand for bicycles near Washington. 



*Project 2* - Object Recognition

> Build a neural network that detects objects from images.

For this project we used a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images.



*Project 3* - Generate TV Scripts

> Use deep learning to generate new scripts for your favorite TV show.

For this project we used a **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)** with **Long-Short Term Memory (LSMT) Cells** to write a script for a Simpsons episode.



*Project 4* - Make a Translation Chatbot

> Build a chatbot that translates text in real time.

Using a **sequene to sequence (seq2seq)** Neural Network to program a English-French translator.



*Project 5* - Generate Faces

> Use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel faces.

In this project a **generative adversarial network (GAN)**, which are actually two neural networks playing a *min-max-game*, trying to fool each other that their output is real, are used to generate new images of handwritten characters and celebrity faces.
